                    <p>If your LinkedIn profile text tells the right story, you will eliminate the time wasters and not receive unwanted contact. If you are approached too often, you can remove your contact information.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer2">
                    <p>This depends on your purpose. I run a network so I say yes to everyone that appears to be legitimate (but I do check out their profile first), but if they start annoying me in any way, I remove them. If they spam me, I report them!.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="answer3">
                    <p>For people who are not actively seeing work, it is tempting to leave your profile unattended until you are looking for work but if your connections notice a sudden increase in activity, they can easily conclude that you are 'in the market'.</p>

                <div class="answer5">
                    <p>This is entirely up to you but I do not recommend it as all of the details you have will then be shared with LinkedIn. If you would like to invite more people to your network, export all your email addresses from your contact list and then invite them to connect with you on LinkedIn through their your email address.</p>
